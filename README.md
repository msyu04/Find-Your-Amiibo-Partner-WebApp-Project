# Inputs and Outputs:
The Region Selector offers North America, Australia, Europe, and Japan as options to choose from. This allows users to see the release date of each Amiibo character based on location.

The Game Button allows users to choose specific games. This restrains certain Amiibo characters from appearing if a user only wants to see characters from one game.

The "Find your Amiibo Partner" button brings a random Amiibo figure and shares its name, image, and release date. Every time it is clicked, a new character is brought for the user to see.
